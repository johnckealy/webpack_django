# Djano Webpack Template

This is a template for integrating webpack with Django. It's intended to serve as a starting point or a reference. It will run babel, a css and js minifier, an autoprefixer, and a scss compiler. Add more modules as required. 


#### Installation

Enter the webpack folder and edit the package.json to personalize the app. Then run

`npm install`

to install all the dependencies. Then enter into the `webpack ` directory and run

`npm run build`

to build the first static assets into the `blog/static/compiled_assets/` folder.
